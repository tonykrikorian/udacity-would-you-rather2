# Would you rather Project

This projects implements the Would You Rather game, where the people have to answer questions with two options, the app
enables de the user to add new questions and answers to that questions.

## TL;DR

To get started developing right away:

- install all project dependencies with `npm install`
- start the development server with `npm start`

```

Remember that good React design practice is to create new JS files for each component and use import/require statements to include them where they are needed.

## Backend Server

To simplify your development process, we've provided a backend server for you to develop against. The provided file [`BooksAPI.js`](src/BooksAPI.js) contains the methods you will need to perform necessary operations on the backend:

- [`getAll`](#getall)
- [`update`](#update)
- [`search`](#search)

The `_DATA.js` file represents a fake database and methods that let you access the data. The only thing you need to edit in the `_DATA.js` file is the value of `avatarURL`. Each user should have an avatar, so you’ll need to add the path to each user’s avatar.

Using the provided starter code, you'll build a React/Redux front end for the application. We recommend using the [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) to bootstrap the project.

## Data

There are two types of objects stored in our database:

- Users
- Questions
